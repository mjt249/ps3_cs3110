(a)

if e0 then e1 else e2

if (e0 : int) and (e1 : 'a) and (e1: 'a)
e0 evaluates to type int, and e1 and e2 evaluate to the same type 'a.

(b)


let x = 1 in
let f = fun y ->
(let x = y+1 in
fun z -> x+y+z) in
let x = 3 in 
let g = f 4 in 
let y = 5 in 
let z = g 6 in 
z


First let binds x to 1, creating environment {x=1}.
Second let binds f to << fun y -> ()>>
