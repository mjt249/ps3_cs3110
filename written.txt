  Exercise 2: Wait till office hours Sunday


Problem 2:
  Exercise 1: **INSERT COMPILES**
              insert (see notes in file). 

              fold_quad () notes:   
              let rec fold_left facc xs =
                match xs with
                [] -> acc
                |x :: xs' -> fold_left f (facc x) xs

              **FOLD_QUAD COMPILES** 
              let rec fold_quad
                 leaf-> function acc (coord*b') (*objectlist*)
                  |Node -> fold_quad(function(fold_quad_function(fold_Quad
                   function 1st quad second quad ....)))


              **UNDERCONSTRUCTION**
   			   fold_region: check leaves and region for correct coordinantes. Test using exercise 2



  Exercise 2: Todo: 
              load_city_data: create tree and use parser to insert lines to tree

              city_search: implement using variation of fold_region

Problem 3:
  Exercise 2: Todo: Test opperations to get errors to raise. Fix nat_of_int for zero and one ****Working on this******

  Exercise 3: Todo: Implement with protective check of NANT.length int conversion not going over max int. Do this for conversion, * and +
